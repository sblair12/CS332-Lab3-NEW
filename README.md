// Lab 4: Multiple Card Games

For this lab, we implemented a program to:
	- play a game called Five Card Draw as instructed
	- play a game called Seven Card Stud as instructed
	- play a game called Texas Hold Em as instructed

For method functions see comments in source files

NOTE:	Selections require space separated items, without an extra space at the end, for input to be valid.
		If too many or too few items are given, the program will ask for the selections to be input again.
		This is the intended functionality.
		Computer from last lab is not functional for SevenCardStud.
